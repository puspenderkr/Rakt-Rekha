# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating firebase’s database with ReactJs in it, was quite a bit of challenge that we faced while building it. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud to have come up with potential solution that addresses the discovered problems, putting the patients and donors in mind. Having noted and pinpointing the pain points, frustrations, needs, emotions of donors due to the following problems:
i) The process of blood donation is cumbersome and tiring for a lot of people
ii) The challenge of not being able to find donors nearby or readily available
iii) Lack of proper awareness to donors on the benefits attached to blood donation to citizens
iv) Poor Motivation to Donate

## What we learned
Learnt to work upon authentication and handling database in Firebase and working in deep with React Js.

## What's next for Rakt-Rekha
We aim to widen up this idea of connecting donors not just for blood but organs too. Improving the UI, features, searches, enabling notification and much more to come ahead.
